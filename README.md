# Calculator
#### _A simple calculator created with HTML/CSS, utilizing Javascript for functionality._ 
## My approach to this program: 
## TODO:
1. previous inputs? above number display (Stretch goal)
2. ~~decimal. make sure it doesnt put 2 in the same number~~
3. ~~display fewer decimal places~~
4. ~~equals > operator > equals = bug~~
5. ~~negative initial number~~
6. set max width for number and box size (Stretch goal)
7. ~~divide by 0~~
8. ~~changing operators (should do nothing but change operators)~~
9. ~~repeatedly pressing 'equals' after an operation should repeat operation~~
10. ~~selecting operators before any numbers (should do nothing)~~
11. ~~'C' should clear the input and change to 'CE'. 'CE' should clear everything~~
