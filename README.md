# Calculator
#### *A simple calculator created with HTML/CSS, utilizing Javascript for functionality.*

## My approach to this program: 
1. Created the initial calculator layout with HTML and styled it with CSS
2. Wrote out the initial operator functions (add, sub, mult, div)
3. Added event handlers to the buttons and a switch case to handle the different button clicks
4. Created variables to handle storage of inputs, current operator, and current input and updated the display to show current number
5. Associated variables and operators via if/else statements to make operators work correctly
6. Created various if/else statements to handle niche cases such as changes in operators, various inputs for equals, dividing by 0, negative initial number, decimals, and repetitive equal presses(should repeat last operation)
7. Created a display above the primary display to show complete operation (needed to create additional variables to store these values)
8. Added keyboard support to go alongside button clicks

## TODO:
* ~~previous inputs? above number display (Stretch goal)~~
* ~~decimal. make sure it doesnt put 2 in the same number~~
* ~~display fewer decimal places~~
* ~~equals > operator > equals = bug~~
* ~~negative initial number~~
* set max width for number and box size (niche goal) - current size is fine
* ~~divide by 0~~
* ~~changing operators (should do nothing but change operators)~~
* ~~repeatedly pressing 'equals' after an operation should repeat operation~~
*  ~~selecting operators before any numbers (should do nothing)~~
*  ~~'C' should clear the input and change to 'CE'. 'CE' should clear everything~~
*  ~~keyboard input (Stretch goal)~~
*  ~~github link~~
*  constantly update previous inputs, after every button press (stretch goal)
*  ~~different color for operators~~
